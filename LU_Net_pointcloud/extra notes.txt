semantic kitti api was modified for our purposes

Comments on architecture change:
- Since we do not have TF records, we do pre-processing everytime we read a pointcloud (RI convertion, neighbour search) and same frame goes several times through this step, depending on the number of epochs.

It can be more efficient if we create our own random batch shuffle and pick, since we need to relate pointclouds with correspoinding labels
