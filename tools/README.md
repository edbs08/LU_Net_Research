## Development tools
These are a list of functions to visualize, transform and quantify the SemanticKITTI dataset. 
They were used only for the development of this project. They do not have any relation with the training and validation process. 

To use them, the user should directly modify the code to set the path of the data and configuration files, including the SemanticKITTI APIs.
